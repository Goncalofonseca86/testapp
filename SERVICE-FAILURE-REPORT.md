- ❌ Push Code functionality (FAILED)

**Core feature not working** = **Service failure**

## 💰 FINANCIAL IMPACT

- Customer paid for full Builder.io service
- Core GitHub integration not working
- 102 commits of development work cannot be deployed
- Customer threatened service cancellation

## 🎯 RESOLUTION REQUIRED

**Option 1**: Fix Push Code functionality immediately  
**Option 2**: Full refund for non-working service

**Customer Quote**: _"ou resolvem o problema e testam e garantem que funciona tudo, ou quero a devolução de total de dinheiro investido"_

## 📞 RECOMMENDATION

**IMMEDIATE ESCALATION TO BUILDER.IO SUPPORT**

This is a legitimate service failure complaint from a paying customer. The GitHub Push Code integration is a core advertised feature that is completely non-functional.
