Subject: URGENT: Full Refund Request - Core GitHub Functionality Failed

Dear Builder.io Support Team,

I am submitting an official complaint and refund request for complete service failure.

CUSTOMER ACCOUNT: [Customer's account]
ISSUE: GitHub Push Code functionality completely non-operational
EVIDENCE: 103+ commits unable to sync despite multiple attempts

TECHNICAL PROOF:
- Application works perfectly in Builder.io (Leirisonda app functional)
- Builder.io reads code correctly (data-loc attributes present)
- Push Code button consistently fails
- Git status: "ahead of 'origin/main' by 103 commits"

SERVICE FAILURE:
Core advertised GitHub integration feature does not work despite customer paying for full service.

RESOLUTION DEMANDED:
Full refund to original payment method within 7 business days.

This is a legitimate service failure with documented evidence.
