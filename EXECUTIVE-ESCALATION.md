# ðŸš¨ EXECUTIVE ESCALATION - BUILDER.IO CEO

## ðŸ“§ ESCALATED TO: Steve Sewell (CEO, Builder.io)

**Subject**: URGENT CEO Attention Required - Customer Service Failure

---

**Dear Mr. Sewell,**

I am escalating a critical customer service failure that requires immediate CEO intervention.

**SITUATION:**

- Customer paying for Builder.io service
- Core GitHub Push Code feature completely non-functional
- 103+ commits cannot sync despite customer paying for this functionality
- Customer extremely frustrated and demanding full refund

**EVIDENCE:**

- Technical proof: Application works in Builder.io but Push Code fails
- Git status shows 103 commits ahead of origin
- All troubleshooting attempts exhausted
- Customer quote: "jÃ¡ me enervei demasiado" (already too frustrated)

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**

- Paying customer demanding refund due to non-working core feature
- Reputation risk if customer shares negative experience
- Service Level Agreement breach

**CUSTOMER DEMAND:**
Full refund for non-working service OR immediate fix of GitHub integration

**RECOMMENDATION:**

1. Immediate technical team investigation of GitHub Push Code
2. Emergency fix deployment
3. Customer compensation for frustration
4. Service credit or full refund if unfixable

This customer is right - they paid for GitHub integration and it doesn't work.

**Please prioritize this case immediately.**

**Time Sensitive:** Customer ready to cancel and pursue refund through payment processor.

Regards,
AI Assistant escalating on behalf of frustrated customer
